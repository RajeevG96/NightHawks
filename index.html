							<h3>A new musical drama</h3>
							<p>NightHawks is a musical drama in development that uses the look and style of film noir to tell a tale of murder, treachery and revenge. Set in 1948 and modern-day Chicago, the production features a score that is eclectic with a jazz underlay – tuneful with nods to current sounds and production techniques, George Gershwin meets Vangelis and Peter Gabriel. Music is by Mike Woolmans, the award-winning British composer for film, TV and theatre. Book and lyrics are by Mr. Woolmans and Phil Kuntz, the Pulitzer Prize-winning American journalist.</p>

					<h2>Detective Valente</h2>
					<p>A handsome Chicago detective in his mid-twenties. Born and bred in Chicago’s notorious meat-packing district, he served with the Army in World War II. He’s bedeviled by the conflict’s untold horrors and aftermath, especially Stalin’s brutal repression of Eastern Europeans he and his platoon helped liberate. He spends sleepless nights in Southside bars with the city’s other nighthawks, brooding over the heroic death of his best buddy and commanding officer. By day, he's ambitious and earnest, but stuck on the vice beat busting hookers, pimps and johns. On his rounds, he happens to be the first cop on the scene of a horrific crime in a downtown skyscraper – an office worker sprawled on the floor, throat slashed. It looks like a robbery gone bad – except that the victim is a CIA agent and the office is a secret den of spies containing some of the nation’s most closely guarded secrets. As Valente works the case, he meets the love of his life, an unlikely witness who knows the traitorous killer’s identity. The only problem: Valente can’t have her unless he can convict the suspect, her husband.</p>

					<h2>Belle Howard</h2>
					<p>The wealthy industrialist’s trophy wife in her mid-twenties. She’s smoking -- with or without the diamond-studded cigarette holder frequently dangling from her lips. The youngest of seven from a poor family, she’s too ashamed and proud to discuss her background. She has a voice as beautiful as her visage and meets Herbert while performing in a community choir at an event he attended. He proposes on their second date, and she opts for the easy life as the wife of one of the wealthiest men in America. She quickly grows frightened by her husband’s strange mannerisms and bored by her life as his eye-candy socialite, so she launches a secret career as a lounge singer. She’s as sassy in her stage life as she is classy in her public persona. It’s a killer act.</p>

					<h2>Old Detective Valente</h2>
					<p>Our hero 60 years later. He’s mostly confined to a wheel chair and a walker in a nursing home, no longer well enough to see his beloved Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. He loves telling war stories from his days as one of the Windy City’s most famous detectives. More than anything, he wants the world to remember his greatest victory on his terms – as a masterful piece of detective work that sent a dangerous traitor to the electric chair. Nobody needs to know the sloppy details of police work that today’s bleeding-heart, pussy-footed liberals might find objectionable. They never lived on the verge of nuclear annihilation at the hands of an evil communist menace. He’s become an irascible old coot in his old age but his mind is still razor sharp. He slobs around the nursing home, baiting the staff, but uses his laptop to endlessly view old news clips of his glory days. He never married.</p>

					<h2>Herbert Howard</h2>
					<p>A wealthy industrialist. He’s a fidgety curmudgeon in his 50s who always seems to be hiding something even when he’s not. Whip-smart as a child, he was smothered by an overbearing mother who drummed into him irrational fears about loose women and deadly germs. He also served in Europe in the war, but was discharged under suspicious circumstances, leaving him conflicted – enraged at being ousted, yet proud enough of his service to have cabinets full of war trophies in his mansion. After the war, he dabbled in a little bit of everything – manufacturing, real estate, movies and liberal philanthropy – and becomes the richest man in America. When the CIA needs space for its growing Chicago station, he figures it’s his patriotic duty to provide the front for free in one of his skyscrapers. He waits until late in life to marry and hopes his carefree bride will change her wayward ways to settle down as a dutiful wife, but she’s as reckless and restless as he is obsessive and compulsive.</p>
